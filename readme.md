let's create a 3d interactive wish garden

we are gonna have a 3d peepal tree once user lands on site

user can click on leaves n they will have a name and wish on it with date. 

users can click on add wish button which gives em a form to submit their wish, name, phone, email, wish id from wishfest. 

------

as we zoom out we will have 6 trees one representing each zone in vizag. 

Theres gonna be a bunch where this 6 trees are. 
Theres are two trees beside it on the right which is GVMC Tree. Vizag Tree. People can wish about/for vizag with these trees.
Theres gonna be a Dharma tree's bunch. which are usually charity based trees. Vizag Volunteers and few other orgs will have trees once they partner with us. 

People can buy wish kits as usual for the orphanages, slums or needy. basically a pay forward for the wish kit. 
50% of the profits will be going into that org wish pools. 

People should be able to load up 100 or 1000 INR and start tipping individual wishes. Vizag wishes or Dharmic Wishes.
